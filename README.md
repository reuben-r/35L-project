UCLA Carpool Connect 

UCLA Commuter Students often have trouble with getting to school everyday, whether it is long commute times or paying for gas and parking every day, some students don't even have a UCLA parking pass, and they need to pay with ParkMobile every day!  In order to solve this problem, we are creating UCLA Carpool Connect for students.

Students go to the Carpool Connect Website where they can copy past their class schedule into a text field, as well as where they live.  Instructions for how to copy past their schedule from MyUCLA are provided on the site.  Students are then able to choose if they are a driver or a passenger at which point they are put into the pool of students.  

Drivers are required to input the average mpg of their vehicle in order to determine the gas split price that will be charged to the passengers.  They also are asked to choose if they would like to split their parking pass price.

Like a dating app, the site will then show passengers a rolling list of drivers which include how much money they are requesting for the gas split, as well as if they are requesting parking reimbursement.  It will also include their information (what time they need to get to school and what time they need to leave).

If a passenger and driver both match each other, they will be provided with each other's phone numbers so they can communicate about arranging the carpool. 

This application will allow commuter students to save a lot of money by carpooling with people who live near them to campus.  

It is important to note that students may also opt for a “split” ride, where they will carpool with one person to school and a different person back home.
