For the MySQL setup, open the file from client-server-app.
Run the code and save it.
Refresh the schemas.

1. Go to be/config

2. Open the file named db.js using any editor

3. Change the password of your localhost(for me is 19991121) and user name(for me is root) if necessary.

4. Be sure to install: 
	
	a. npm i mysql2
	b. npm i express
   For backend needed lib

5. Run npm start on be first then run npm start for fe. 
(Backend should be ready first)

6. Open mySQL workbench on local machine and connect a new database
7. Create a scheme named "userdb"
8. Execute the SQL command found in "userDB.sql" to create the necessary tables
